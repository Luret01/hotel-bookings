******HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS******

**OBJECTIVE**


The objective of this project is to better understand booking details and identify factors that affect bookings and cancellations in a city and resort hotel to reduce losses and maximize profit. This project would answer and cover the following:

•	What kind of guests have the highest number of bookings?

•	What months are the peak and low seasons for both hotels?

•	What countries do most of the bookings come from?

•	What factors affect cancellations?

•	Recommendations 

**DATA SOURCING**

The data was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand.

It was organized in a spreadsheet and could be accessed as a csv file. This data set contains 199,330 rows of booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, lead time, cancellations and arrival date among others.

The data cleaning and  visualizations were carried out using Power BI, where meaningful insights are created for storytelling to cover all the objectives. The first page contains a summary of hotel bookings, and the second page contains further analysis of cancellations.

**INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

The summary page contains details about the bookings by hotel type, bookings by guest type, arrival months, lead times and countries with the highest bookings

•	Most bookings come from Europe and the countries with the highest number of bookings are: Portugal, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain. Hotels can create geo- specific marketing strategies targeting these countries. 

•	Transient guests account for majority of the bookings and are more likely to book a city hotel than a resort hotel. The least number of bookings come from groups. Initiatives can be created to serve groups. These may include team-building retreats, corporate meetings and events, offering a coworking space for self-employed people and small businesses, corporate events and meetings, and, of course, weddings. These can all be outstanding sources of ancillary revenue.

•	Both hotels have majority of their guest arriving in August and July which is during the summer season when most people travel for vacations. January and December are low season periods for both hotels as these are winter months. Creating packages like family packages at discounted rates during these low season periods could be helpful in increasing revenue.

•	Out of all hotel bookings made during the time period, 37.04% of them were cancelled. This not only directly impacts the revenue, but also leads to poor marketing
The cancellation analysis gives a better understanding of guest behavior in relation to cancellations.

•	Although the city hotel has a greater number of bookings, it also has the highest cancellation rate. City hotel also has a longer lead time and bookings with longer lead times are more likely to be cancelled. 

•	We can observe that most of the bookings are made through Online Travel Agents, but they also account for the highest number of cancellations.  This shows that bookings made through Travel Agents might in fact be easier and more convenient for guests. Hotels keep track of other properties in the listing page to understand what they’re doing right and how they could leverage that information to reduce cancellations at their property.

•	Bookings that do not require any form of deposit are more likely to be cancelled than bookings that require deposits. Bookings that require a refundable deposit have the lowest cancellation rate. Hotels could enact policies that require guests to pay refundable deposit before booking or they could consider promoting a Prepaid or Advance Purchase rate. If the guest pays at the time of booking, they receive a small discount. 

**CONCLUSION**

If a guest needs to cancel, they will. However, the more aware hotels are of their cancellation rates and where they are coming from, the better they’ll be able to create a plan and stay in control.
